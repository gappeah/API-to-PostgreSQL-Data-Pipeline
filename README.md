# API-to-PostgreSQL-Data-Pipeline

Project Overview
Project Name: MarketPulse Description: MarketPulse is a hypothetical data pipeline project designed to fetch real-time market trend data from a public API and store it in a PostgreSQL database for analysis. This proof-of-concept demonstrates how a company (e.g., a tech firm like Intel) could leverage external data to inform hardware demand forecasting or supply chain optimization. The pipeline is built with Python, ensuring scalability and ease of integration into existing systems.
Objective
To create a lightweight, reliable system that:
	•	Retrieves JSON data from a public API (e.g., a mock market trends API).
	•	Stores the data in a PostgreSQL database.
	•	Provides a foundation for analytics or reporting, suitable for a business case pitch.
Prerequisites
	•	Python 3.8+: Ensure Python is installed.
	•	PostgreSQL 14+: A running PostgreSQL instance.
	•	Dependencies:
	◦	requests: For API calls.
	◦	psycopg2: For PostgreSQL connectivity.
	•	API Access: This example uses a fictional public API (https://api.marketpulse.example/trends) for demonstration. Replace with a real API endpoint as needed.
	•	Environment: A .env file for sensitive credentials (e.g., database connection details).
Setup Instructions
	1	Install Dependencies: pip install requests psycopg2-binary python-dotenv
	2	
	3	Set Up PostgreSQL:
	◦	Create a database named marketpulse_db.
	◦	Run the following SQL to create a table for market trend data: CREATE TABLE market_trends (
	◦	    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	◦	    trend_id VARCHAR(50),
	◦	    category VARCHAR(100),
	◦	    value FLOAT,
	◦	    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
	◦	);
	◦	
	4	Configure Environment Variables:
	◦	Create a .env file in the project root: DB_HOST=localhost
	◦	DB_PORT=5432
	◦	DB_NAME=marketpulse_db
	◦	DB_USER=your_username
	◦	DB_PASSWORD=your_password
	◦	API_URL=https://api.marketpulse.example/trends
	◦

Python Code
Below is the Python script (main.py) that fetches data from the API and stores it in PostgreSQL:
import requests
import psycopg2
from psycopg2 import Error
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
from datetime import datetime

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Database connection parameters
db_params = {
    "host": os.getenv("DB_HOST"),
    "port": os.getenv("DB_PORT"),
    "database": os.getenv("DB_NAME"),
    "user": os.getenv("DB_USER"),
    "password": os.getenv("DB_PASSWORD")
}

# API endpoint
api_url = os.getenv("API_URL")

def fetch_api_data():
    """Fetch market trend data from the API."""
    try:
        response = requests.get(api_url)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise exception for bad status codes
        return response.json()
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error fetching API data: {e}")
        return None

def connect_to_db():
    """Establish PostgreSQL connection."""
    try:
        connection = psycopg2.connect(**db_params)
        return connection
    except Error as e:
        print(f"Error connecting to PostgreSQL: {e}")
        return None

def insert_data(connection, data):
    """Insert API data into PostgreSQL."""
    try:
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        insert_query = """
            INSERT INTO market_trends (trend_id, category, value, timestamp)
            VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s)
        """
        for item in data:
            cursor.execute(insert_query, (
                item.get("trend_id"),
                item.get("category"),
                item.get("value"),
                datetime.now()
            ))
        connection.commit()
        print("Data inserted successfully.")
    except Error as e:
        print(f"Error inserting data: {e}")
        connection.rollback()
    finally:
        cursor.close()

def main():
    # Fetch data from API
    data = fetch_api_data()
    if not data:
        return

    # Connect to database
    connection = connect_to_db()
    if not connection:
        return

    # Insert data
    insert_data(connection, data)

    # Clean up
    connection.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Example API Data
The fictional API returns data in this format:
[
    {"trend_id": "T001", "category": "Semiconductors", "value": 125.5},
    {"trend_id": "T002", "category": "CPUs", "value": 89.3}
]
Running the Pipeline
	1	Ensure PostgreSQL is running and the .env file is configured.
	2	Run the script: python main.py
	3	
	4	Verify data in PostgreSQL: SELECT * FROM market_trends;
	5	
Business Case for Intel
This pipeline could be pitched to Intel as a tool for:
	•	Market Monitoring: Tracking real-time demand for hardware components (e.g., CPUs, GPUs) to optimize production.
	•	Scalability: The modular design allows integration with Intel’s internal analytics platforms.
	•	Cost Efficiency: Uses open-source tools (Python, PostgreSQL) to minimize costs.
	•	Extensibility: Can be extended to include advanced analytics (e.g., forecasting models) or additional data sources.
Future Enhancements
	•	Add error logging to a file or monitoring service.
	•	Implement scheduling (e.g., using schedule or cron) for periodic API calls.
	•	Add data validation before insertion.
	•	Integrate with Intel’s data warehouse for broader analytics.
Notes
	•	This is a proof-of-concept. For production, add robust error handling, authentication for the API, and connection pooling for PostgreSQL.
	•	Replace the fictional API with a real endpoint (e.g., Alpha Vantage for market data).
	•	For a pitch to Intel, emphasize alignment with their data-driven decision-making processes and potential integration with their supply chain systems.

Notes on Realism and Creativity
	•	Realism: The README follows standard software project conventions, with clear setup instructions, modular Python code, and a business case tailored to a tech company like Intel. The use of psycopg2, requests, and .env for configuration aligns with industry practices.
	•	Creativity: The fictional “MarketPulse” project and API add a creative spin while remaining plausible. The business case ties to Intel’s interest in market trends for hardware, making it relevant.
	•	Pitch to Intel: The scenario assumes Intel as a stakeholder interested in data-driven insights, which fits their focus on innovation and supply chain optimization.
